# Code from Python Crash Course

#### I've been learning Python as a hobby and decided to share chapter wise code from the [Python Crash Course](https://nostarch.com/python-crash-course-3rd-edition) book from NoStarchPress.

I plan to use the knowledge to build something for fun. What that is I'm not sure yet.
